## Angles, Degrees, and Radians

An angle measures an amount of rotation in the plane. The most important units of measure used to specify angles are degrees ($$^{\circ}$$) and radians (rad).

When we specify the angle between two rays in radians, we are actually measuring the **length of the intercepted arc of a unit circle** (a circle centered at the origin with radius 1)

The circumference of a unit circle is  $$2\pi$$, with  $$\pi$$ approximately equal to 3.14159265359. Therefore, 2Ï€ radians represents a complete revolution.

Since $$360^{\circ}$$ = $$2\pi$$ rad (r = 1 since it's the unit circle), $$180^{\circ}$$ =  $$\pi$$ rad.

## Trig Functions

### Trig Identities

A number of identities can be derived based on the symmetry of the unit circle:

A number of identities can be derived based on the *Pythagorean theorem*:

The following identities involve taking a trig function on the sum or difference of two angles:

If we apply the sum identities to the special case where a and b are the same, we get the following double angle identities:

We often need to solve for an unknown side length or angle in a triangle, in terms of the known side lengths or angles. For these types of problems the *law of sines and law of cosines* are helpful.

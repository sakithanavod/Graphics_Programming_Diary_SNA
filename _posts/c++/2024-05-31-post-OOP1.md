# Class Definition
A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a data structure and methods to manipulate that data.

```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    // Public members (accessible from outside the class)
    int publicMember;

    // Constructor
    ClassName() {
        // Constructor code
    }

    // Method
    void someMethod() {
        // Method code
    }

private:
    // Private members (accessible only within the class)
    int privateMember;
};
```

## Friend Functions and Classes
## Friend Functions
Non-member functions that have access to private and protected members of the class.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int privateVar;
public:
    friend void myFriendFunction(MyClass& obj);
};

void myFriendFunction(MyClass& obj) {
    obj.privateVar = 10; // Access private member
}
```

## Friend Classes
Classes that have access to private and protected members of another class.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int privateVar;
public:
    friend void myFriendFunction(MyClass& obj);
};

void myFriendFunction(MyClass& obj) {
    obj.privateVar = 10; // Access private member
}
```

## Object Creation
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created. (We talk more on this n memory management)

 ```cpp
int main() {
    MyClass myObj; // Create an object of MyClass
    myObj.myNumber = 15; // Access public member
    myObj.myFunction(); // Call public member function
    return 0;
}
```

# Constructors
Constructors are special member functions that are executed when an object of a class is created. They are used to initialize objects.

## Types of Constructors

### Default Constructor
* A constructor that takes no arguments.
* If no constructor is provided by the programmer, the compiler *generates* a default constructor.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        // Initialization code
    }
};
```
In C++, if you define any constructor, including a parameterized constructor, the compiler **does not** automatically generate a default constructor. You have to explicitly define a default constructor if you need one.

*Example without a Default Constructor*

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int value) : Value(value) {}

private:
    int Value;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj; // Error: no default constructor available
    MyClass obj2(10); // OK: uses the parameterized constructor
    return 0;
}
```

*Example with an Explicit Default Constructor*

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() : Value(0) {} // Explicit default constructor
    MyClass(int value) : Value(value) {}

private:
    int Value;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj; // OK: uses the default constructor
    MyClass obj2(10); // OK: uses the parameterized constructor
    return 0;
}
```

**Alternative: Using `default` keyword**
You can also use the `default` keyword to instruct the compiler to generate the default constructor for you:

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() = default; // Compiler-generated default constructor
    MyClass(int value) : Value(value) {}

private:
    int Value;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj; // OK: uses the default constructor
    MyClass obj2(10); // OK: uses the parameterized constructor
    return 0;
}
```

### Parameterized Constructor
* A constructor that takes one or more arguments.
* Used to initialize objects with specific values.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int x) {
        // Initialization code
    }
};
```

### Copy Constructor
* A constructor that initializes an object using another object of the same class.
* It is called when:
    - An object is initialized from another object of the same type.
    - An object is passed by value to a function.
    - An object is returned by value from a function.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(const MyClass &other) {
        // Copy initialization code
    }
};
```

#### Shallow Copy
Copies the values of the member variables as they are, including pointers, **without** creating new copies of dynamically allocated memory.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int* data;
    MyClass(int value) {
        data = new int(value);
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(10);
    MyClass obj2 = obj1;  // Default copy constructor
    return 0;
}
```
The problem with shallow copy is that in the above example, both `obj1` and `obj2` will have `data` pointing to the same memory location, which can lead to issues such as double deletion.

#### User-Defined Copy Constructor (For Deep copies)
To avoid issues with shallow copies, especially when dealing with dynamic memory, a user-defined copy constructor is used to perform a deep copy.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int* data;
    MyClass(int value) {
        data = new int(value);
    }

    // User-defined copy constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        data = new int(*other.data);  // Deep copy
    }

    ~MyClass() {
        delete data;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(10);
    MyClass obj2 = obj1;  // Calls user-defined copy constructor
    return 0;
}
```
In the above example, obj2 has its own copy of the data, avoiding issues like double deletion.

#### Copy Constructor vs. Assignment Operator
* Copy Constructor: Initializes a **new object** as a copy of an existing object.
* Assignment Operator: Assigns the contents of one **existing object** to another existing object.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int* data;
    MyClass(int value) {
        data = new int(value);
    }

    // Copy constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        data = new int(*other.data);
    }

    // Assignment operator
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this == &other) return *this;  // Self-assignment check
        delete data;  // Clean up existing resource
        data = new int(*other.data);  // Deep copy
        return *this;
    }

    ~MyClass() {
        delete data;
    }
};
```

### Move Constructor
A move constructor allows an object to take *ownership* of resources from another object, leaving the source object in a *valid but unspecified state*. This can significantly improve performance by avoiding deep copies, especially for objects that manage dynamic memory or other resources.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(MyClass&& other) noexcept; // Move constructor
};
```
#### When is it Used?
The move constructor is called in the following situations:

* When an object is initialized with a temporary (rvalue) of the same type.
* When an object is explicitly cast to an rvalue using `std::move`. (We'll talk about move semantics later)
* When a function returns an object by value, and the compiler applies Return Value Optimization (RVO).

#### What does it mean by Ownership of a object?
Ownership of an object refers to the responsibility for managing the **lifetime and resources of that object**. When a piece of code "owns" an object, it is responsible for ensuring that the object's resources are properly allocated and deallocated.

Ownership determines who is responsible for cleaning up the object's resources, such as memory, when the object is no longer needed.

##### Types of Ownership
* Exclusive Ownership:
    - Unique ownership is typically managed using `std::unique_ptr`. (We will talk more on smart pointers later)
    - Only one owner at a time.
    - The owner is responsible for deleting the object.
    
* Shared Ownership:
    - Shared ownership is managed using `std::shared_ptr`.
    - Multiple owners can share the responsibility for an object.
    - The object is deleted when the last owner releases it.

* Non-ownership:
    - A raw pointer (T*) or reference (T&) can be used to access an object without owning it.
    - The code using a non-owning pointer/reference is not responsible for managing the object's lifetime.

*Example usage of move constructor*

 ```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility> // For std::move

class MyClass {
public:
    int* data;

    // Default constructor
    MyClass() : data(nullptr) {
        std::cout << "Default constructor\n";
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    MyClass(int value) {
        data = new int(value);
        std::cout << "Parameterized constructor\n";
    }

    // Move constructor
    MyClass(MyClass&& other) noexcept : data(other.data) {
        other.data = nullptr; // Leave the source object in a valid state
        std::cout << "Move constructor\n";
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        delete data;
        std::cout << "Destructor\n";
    }

    // Display the value
    void display() const {
        if (data) {
            std::cout << "Value: " << *data << "\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "No data\n";
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(42); // Parameterized constructor
    MyClass obj2(std::move(obj1)); // Move constructor

    obj1.display(); // No data
    obj2.display(); // Value: 42

    return 0;
}
```
Here, Move Constructor Transfers ownership of the resource from *other* to the *current object*. The other objectâ€™s resource pointer is set to nullptr to avoid *double deletion*.
{: .notice--success}

##### Best Practices
* `noexcept`: Marking the move constructor `noexcept` is recommended because many standard library functions require this guarantee for     performance optimizations. (`noexcept` indicates whether a function is guaranteed not to throw any exceptions.)
* Move Assignment Operator: If you implement a move constructor, consider implementing the move assignment operator as well:

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Move assignment operator
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete data; // Release any current resource
            data = other.data; // Transfer ownership
            other.data = nullptr; // Leave source in valid state
        }
        return *this;
    }
};
```

## Destructors
A destructor is a special member function in a class that is called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor's primary role is to release resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime, such as dynamically allocated memory, file handles, or network connections.

### Key Points about Destructors
1. Naming: The destructor has the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (`~`).
2. No Return Type: Destructors do not have a return type, not even `void`.
3. No Parameters: Destructors do not take any parameters.
4. Automatic Invocation: Destructors are automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
5. Single Destructor: Each class can have only one destructor.
6. Virtual Destructors: For base classes, especially those meant to be inherited from, it is often a good practice to declare the destructor as `virtual`

*Example: Consider a class that manages a dynamic array:*

 ```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass(int size) : size_(size), data_(new int[size]) {
        std::cout << "Constructor: Allocating resources\n";
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        delete[] data_;
        std::cout << "Destructor: Releasing resources\n";
    }

    void print() const {
        for (int i = 0; i < size_; ++i) {
            std::cout << data_[i] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }

private:
    int size_;
    int* data_;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj(10); // Constructor called
    obj.print();
    // Destructor will be called automatically here

    return 0;
}
```

### Virtual Destructors
When dealing with inheritance, if a base class has *virtual functions*, it is a good practice to make the destructor *virtual*. This ensures that the derived class's destructor is called when an object is deleted through a base class pointer.

 ```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() {
        std::cout << "Base Destructor\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() override {
        std::cout << "Derived Destructor\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    delete obj; // Correctly calls Derived destructor, then Base destructor

    return 0;
}
```
### Destructor Best Practices
1. Free Resources: Ensure that all resources (memory, file handles, etc.) acquired by the object are released in the destructor.
2. Virtual Destructors in Base Classes: If a class is intended to be a base class, declare its destructor as `virtual`.
3. Destructor and Exception Safety: Destructors should not throw exceptions. If a destructor throws an exception and another exception is already active, the program will call `std::terminate`. Ensure that all destructors are `noexcept` by default.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    ~MyClass() noexcept {
        // Clean up code here, ensuring no exceptions are thrown
    }
};
```

## Constructor Initialization List
In C++, a constructor initialization list is used to initialize member variables and base class subobjects *before* the body of the constructor is executed. This can lead to more efficient code and is often necessary for initializing *const members, reference members, and base class members*.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int x, int y) : a(x), b(y) {
        // Constructor body
    }

private:
    int a;
    int b;
};
```

### Advantages of Using Initialization Lists
1. Efficiency:
    * Direct initialization of members can be more efficient than assignment in the constructor body, especially for complex objects.
    * Avoids the creation of default-constructed temporary objects that are then overwritten.

2. Initialization of `const` Members:
    * `const` members must be initialized in the initialization list since they cannot be assigned a value in the constructor body.

3. Initialization of Reference Members:
    * References must be initialized when they are created, so they must be initialized in the initialization list.

4. Initialization of Base Class Subobjects:
    * Base class constructors must be called in the initialization list if you need to pass arguments to them.


*Example: Initialization of Const and Reference Members*

 ```cpp
class Line {
public:
    Line(const Point& start, const Point& end) : start_(start), end_(end) {}

    void Print() const {
        std::cout << "Line from ";
        start_.Print();
        std::cout << " to ";
        end_.Print();
        std::cout << "\n";
    }

private:
    const Point start_;
    const Point end_;
};
```

*Example: Initialization of Base Class*

 ```cpp
class Base {
public:
    Base(int value) : value_(value) {
        std::cout << "Base constructor\n";
    }

private:
    int value_;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived(int value, int extra) : Base(value), extra_(extra) {
        std::cout << "Derived constructor\n";
    }

private:
    int extra_;
};
```

### Best Practices
1. Initialize in Declaration Order:
    * Members are initialized in the **order** they are **declared in the class**, not the order they appear in the **initialization list**. Ensure your initialization list follows this order to avoid warnings or errors.

2. Prefer Initialization List Over Assignment:
    * Use the initialization list to set member variables to avoid unnecessary default construction and assignment.

3. Handle Complex Initialization Logic:
    * Use the initialization list for simple initializations and reserve the constructor body for more complex logic if needed.

## Delegating Constructors
Delegating constructors in C++ allow a constructor to delegate its initialization to another constructor in the same class. This can simplify code, reduce redundancy, and centralize initialization logic.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int x, int y) : MyClass(x) { 
        // Additional initialization for two-parameter constructor
    }

    MyClass(int x) : a(x), b(0) {
        // Initialization for one-parameter constructor
    }

private:
    int a;
    int b;
};
```

## Explicit Constructors
In C++, the `explicit` keyword is used to prevent implicit conversions and copy-initialization that might otherwise occur. This keyword can be particularly useful for constructors to avoid unintentional conversions that could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

By default, single-parameter constructors allow **implicit type** conversions, which can lead to subtle bugs.

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    explicit MyClass(int x) : value(x) {}

private:
    int value;
};
```

*Example: use the `explicit` keyword*
Consider a class with a single-parameter constructor that can be used for implicit conversions:

 ```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    // Constructor without explicit
    MyClass(int x) : value(x) {
        std::cout << "Constructor called with value: " << value << "\n";
    }

private:
    int value;
};

void printMyClass(const MyClass& obj) {
    std::cout << "printMyClass called\n";
}

int main() {
    MyClass obj1 = 10; // Implicit conversion from int to MyClass
    printMyClass(20);  // Implicit conversion from int to MyClass

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the constructor allows implicit conversion from `int` to `MyClass`, which might not be intended.

Marking the constructor as explicit prevents implicit conversions:

 ```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    // Explicit constructor
    explicit MyClass(int x) : value(x) {
        std::cout << "Constructor called with value: " << value << "\n";
    }

private:
    int value;
};

void printMyClass(const MyClass& obj) {
    std::cout << "printMyClass called\n";
}

int main() {
    // MyClass obj1 = 10; // Error: implicit conversion not allowed
    MyClass obj2(20); // OK: direct initialization

    printMyClass(MyClass(30)); // OK: explicit conversion
    // printMyClass(40); // Error: implicit conversion not allowed

    return 0;
}
```
### Best Practices
Use explicit for Single-Argument Constructors: Always consider using explicit for constructors that can be called with a single argument to prevent unintended implicit conversions.

## Rule of Five
In C++11 and later, the *Rule of Three* has been expanded to the *Rule of Five*. The Rule of Five states that if a class requires a **user-defined destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment operator**, it likely requires **user-defined move constructor and move assignment operator** as well. This rule helps ensure proper resource management and prevents potential issues with resource ownership.

### The Five Special Member Functions
1. **Destructor:** Cleans up resources when an object is destroyed.
2. **Copy Constructor:** Creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
3. **Copy Assignment Operator:** Assigns the state of an existing object to another existing object.
4. **Move Constructor**: Transfers ownership of resources from a temporary object to a new object.
5. **Move Assignment Operator:** Transfers ownership of resources from a temporary object to an existing object.

*Example: Consider a class that manages a dynamic array:*

 ```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // for std::copy

class MyClass {
public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass(int size) : size_(size), data_(new int[size]) {
        std::cout << "Constructor\n";
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        delete[] data_;
        std::cout << "Destructor\n";
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) : size_(other.size_), data_(new int[other.size_]) {
        
        /*
        *  other.data_ = beginning of the range to be copied
        *  other.data_ + size_ = end of the range to be copied (one past the last element).
        *  data_ = his is the destination where the elements will be copied to.
        */
        std::copy(other.data_, other.data_ + other.size_, data_);
        std::cout << "Copy Constructor\n";
    }

    // Copy Assignment Operator
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data_;
            size_ = other.size_;
            data_ = new int[size_];

            /*
            *  other.data_ = beginning of the range to be copied
            *  other.data_ + size_ = end of the range to be copied (one past the last element).
            *  data_ = his is the destination where the elements will be copied to.
            */
            std::copy(other.data_, other.data_ + size_, data_);
        }
        std::cout << "Copy Assignment Operator\n";
        return *this;
    }

    // Move Constructor
    MyClass(MyClass&& other) noexcept : size_(other.size_), data_(other.data_) {
        other.size_ = 0;
        other.data_ = nullptr;
        std::cout << "Move Constructor\n";
    }

    // Move Assignment Operator
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data_;
            size_ = other.size_;
            data_ = other.data_;
            other.size_ = 0;
            other.data_ = nullptr;
        }
        std::cout << "Move Assignment Operator\n";
        return *this;
    }

    void Print() const {
        for (int i = 0; i < size_; ++i) {
            std::cout << data_[i] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }

public:
    int size_;
    int* data_;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(10); // Constructor
    MyClass obj2 = obj1; // Copy Constructor
    obj2 = obj1; // Copy Assignment Operator
    MyClass obj3 = std::move(obj1); // Move Constructor
    obj2 = std::move(obj3); // Move Assignment Operator

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**
1. Constructor: Allocates memory for a dynamic array.
2. Destructor: Releases the allocated memory.
3. Copy Constructor: Creates a deep copy of the dynamic array.
4. Copy Assignment Operator: Releases the current object's resources, then creates a deep copy of the dynamic array.
5. Move Constructor: Transfers ownership of the dynamic array from a temporary object to a new object, nullifying the temporary object's pointer to avoid double deletion.
6. Move Assignment Operator: Releases the current object's resources, then transfers ownership of the dynamic array from a temporary object to the current object, nullifying the temporary object's pointer to avoid double deletion.

### Best Practices
* Default Implementations: Use `default` to explicitly specify the default behavior of special member functions if they are appropriate (If your class does not manage any resources [like dynamic memory, file handles, or network connections], the default implementations are usually appropriate.):

 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() = default;
    ~MyClass() = default;
    MyClass(const MyClass&) = default;
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass&) = default;
    MyClass(MyClass&&) = default;
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&&) = default;
};
```

* Delete Unwanted Operations: If a class should not be copyable or movable, explicitly delete the corresponding functions:


 ```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() = default;
    ~MyClass() = default;
    MyClass(const MyClass&) = delete;
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass&) = delete;
    MyClass(MyClass&&) = delete;
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&&) = delete;
};
```

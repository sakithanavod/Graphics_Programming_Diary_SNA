# Inheritance in C++
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. 

The class that inherits is called the *derived class* (or child class), and the class being inherited from is called the *base class* (or parent class).

To define a class that inherits from another class, you use a colon followed by the access specifier and the name of the base class.

```cpp
class BaseClass {
public:
    int baseNumber;
    void baseFunction() {
        // Function implementation
    }
};

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
public:
    int derivedNumber;
    void derivedFunction() {
        // Function implementation
    }
};
```
## Access levels of Inheritance
In C++, the access specifier (`public`, `protected`, or `private`) used in inheritance determines the access level of the inherited members of the base class in the derived class.

It affects how these members can be accessed by the derived class, and also how the derived class itself can be used. 

1. Public Inheritance (`class DerivedClass : public BaseClass`)
Public and protected members of BaseClass remain **public** and **protected**, respectively, in DerivedClass.

2. Protected Inheritance (`class DerivedClass : protected BaseClass`)
Public and protected members of BaseClass become **protected** in DerivedClass.

3. Private Inheritance Inheritance (`class DerivedClass : private BaseClass`)
Public and protected members of BaseClass become **private** in DerivedClass.

## Constructors and Destructors
Constructors and destructors in derived classes should properly initialize and clean up resources. 

* The base class constructor is called before the derived class constructor
* and the derived class destructor is called before the base class destructor.

```cpp
class BaseClass {
public:
    BaseClass() {
        // Base class constructor
    }
    ~BaseClass() {
        // Base class destructor
    }
};

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
public:
    DerivedClass() {
        // Derived class constructor
    }
    ~DerivedClass() {
        // Derived class destructor
    }
};
```

## Overriding Member Functions
Derived classes can override member functions of the base class. To indicate that a function is overriding a base class function, use the `override` keyword.

```cpp
class BaseClass {
public:
    virtual void myFunction() {
        // Base class implementation
    }
};

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
public:
    void myFunction() override {
        // Derived class implementation
    }
};
```

## Virtual Functions and Polymorphism
Virtual functions allow derived classes to override base class functions to provide specific behavior. Polymorphism enables the use of base class pointers or references to call derived class functions.

```cpp
class BaseClass {
public:
    virtual void myFunction() {
        // Base class implementation
    }
};

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
public:
    void myFunction() override {
        // Derived class implementation
    }
};

// uses base class object type as a param!
void executeFunction(BaseClass& obj) {
    obj.myFunction();
}

int main() {
    BaseClass baseObj;
    DerivedClass derivedObj;

    executeFunction(baseObj); // Calls BaseClass::myFunction
    executeFunction(derivedObj); // Calls DerivedClass::myFunction

    return 0;
}
```

## Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes
A pure virtual function is a function declared in the base class that has **no implementation** and **must** be overridden in derived classes. Classes containing pure virtual functions are called abstract classes and cannot be instantiated.

```cpp
class AbstractClass {
public:
    virtual void pureVirtualFunction() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class ConcreteClass : public AbstractClass {
public:
    void pureVirtualFunction() override {
        // Implementation of pure virtual function
    }
};
```
## Multiple Inheritance
C++ supports multiple inheritance, where a derived class can inherit from more than one base class.

```cpp
class Base1 {
public:
    void function1() {
        // Implementation
    }
};

class Base2 {
public:
    void function2() {
        // Implementation
    }
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
    // Inherits from both Base1 and Base2
};
```

# Polymorphism in C++
Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a **common base class**. It is a concept that enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).

Polymorphism is mainly achieved in C++ through:
* Function Overloading
* Operator Overloading
* Virtual Functions

## Function Overloading
Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name to exist, differentiated by their parameter types and number.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void display(int i) {
        std::cout << "Integer: " << i << std::endl;
    }

    void display(double d) {
        std::cout << "Double: " << d << std::endl;
    }

    void display(std::string s) {
        std::cout << "String: " << s << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.display(10);         // Calls display(int)
    obj.display(10.5);       // Calls display(double)
    obj.display("Hello");    // Calls display(std::string)
    return 0;
}
```

## Operator Overloading
Operator overloading allows you to redefine the way operators work for user-defined types (classes).

```cpp
class Complex {
private:
    float real;
    float imag;

public:
    Complex() : real(0), imag(0) {}
    Complex(float r, float i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    Complex operator + (const Complex &c) {
        return Complex(real + c.real, imag + c.imag);
    }

    void display() {
        std::cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(3.3, 4.4), c2(1.1, 2.2);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;
    c3.display();  // Displays: 4.4 + 6.6i
    return 0;
}
```

## Virtual Functions and Runtime Polymorphism
Virtual functions allow you to create a function in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes. They enable runtime polymorphism, where the call to an overridden function is resolved at runtime.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        std::cout << "Base class" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        std::cout << "Derived class" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* b;
    Derived d;
    b = &d;
    b->show();  // Calls Derived's show() because of virtual function
    return 0;
}
```

**Virtual Destructors:** When using polymorphism, it's crucial to have a virtual destructor in the base class to ensure proper cleanup of derived class objects.

# Encapsulation and Access Specifiers in C++
Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It is the practice of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. 

## Benefits of Encapsulation
 * **Data Hiding:** Protects an objectâ€™s internal state by preventing outside code from directly accessing and modifying it.
 * **Modularity:** Groups related data and functions together, promoting modularity
 * **Maintenance:** Makes code easier to maintain and modify since changes to the internal implementation of a class do not affect the code that uses the class.
 * **Control:** Provides controlled access to data through well-defined interfaces (getters and setters).

## Access Specifiers
Access specifiers in C++ are keywords that set the accessibility of members (variables and functions) of a class. They define how the members of the class can be accessed. The three primary access specifiers are `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

* **Public:** Members declared as `public` are accessible from anywhere outside the class but within the scope of the program. Public members can be accessed directly using the object of the class.
* **Private:** Members declared as `private` are accessible only within the class. They cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Private members are used to hide the internal details of the class.
* **Protected:** Members declared as `protected` are accessible within the class and by derived classes. However, they are not accessible from outside the class.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int publicVar;

private:
    int privateVar;

protected:
    int protectedVar;
};

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.publicVar = 10;  // Accessing public variable
    obj.privateVar = 10;  // Not accessible

    DerivedClass obj;
    obj.protectedVar = 10; // Accessing protected variable
    return 0;
}
```

# Abstraction in C++
Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, and working at the most relevant level of inheritance for a particular aspect of the problem.

## Key Concepts of Abstraction
1. **Simplification:** Abstraction reduces complexity by hiding irrelevant details and showing only the essential features of the object.
2. **Modeling:** It models real-world entities in a way that captures only the necessary attributes and behaviors.
3. **Interfaces:** Defines the interactions between objects while hiding the implementation details.

## Implementing Abstraction in C++
Abstraction in C++ can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces **(pure virtual functions)**.

### Abstract Classes
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a base class. It contains **at least one pure virtual function**. The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common interface for all derived classes.

```cpp
class AbstractClass {
public:
    virtual void pureVirtualFunction() = 0;  // Pure virtual function

    void concreteFunction() {
        // Implementation of a regular function
        std::cout << "This is a concrete function in an abstract class." << std::endl;
    }
};

class ConcreteClass : public AbstractClass {
public:
    void pureVirtualFunction() override {
        std::cout << "Implementation of pure virtual function in derived class." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // AbstractClass obj;  // This would cause a compilation error because AbstractClass cannot be instantiated
    ConcreteClass obj;
    obj.pureVirtualFunction();  // Calls the overridden pure virtual function
    obj.concreteFunction();     // Calls the concrete function from the base class
    return 0;
}
```

### Interfaces in C++
In C++, interfaces are usually represented by abstract classes that have only pure virtual functions and no data members or member function implementations.

```cpp
class Interface {
public:
    virtual void function1() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
    virtual void function2() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};

class Implementation : public Interface {
public:
    void function1() override {
        std::cout << "Implementation of function1." << std::endl;
    }

    void function2() override {
        std::cout << "Implementation of function2." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Implementation obj;
    obj.function1();
    obj.function2();
    return 0;
}
```
